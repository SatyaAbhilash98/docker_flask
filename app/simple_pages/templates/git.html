                        <p>Branches:</p>
                        <p>There is a main branch which has our final work, and we can create new branches in the repo
                            to
                            make changes. Branches are way of saving our work in our repo but not in our main branch.
                            After
                            making the changes in the project we can merge our branches to main branch to finally deploy
                            project. So typically branching means you diverge from the main line of development and
                            continue
                            to do work without messing with that main line.
                            We can create branches using git branch “branch name” command. To switch branches, we can
                            use
                            git checkout “branch name”.</p>
                        <p>Merge:</p>
                        <p>Merge is used to join two or more development histories together. For example, git merge
                            command
                            lets us take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them
                            into
                            a single branch. git merge takes two commit pointers, usually the branch tips, and will find
                            a
                            common base commit between them. Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new
                            "merge
                            commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.
                        </p>
                        <p>Commit:</p>
                        <p>
                            The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.
                            Committed
                            snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them
                            unless
                            you explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of git commit, the git add command is used
                            to
                            promote or 'stage' changes to the project that will be stored in a commit. These two
                            commands
                            git commit, and git add are two of the most frequently used. The command git commit -m
                            “message”
                            will let us make a change in the repo and it leaves a message in the folder where the
                            changes
                            were made.</p>
                        <p>Tagging:</p>
                        <p>
                            The command git tag “name” is used to create tags in the repo. Tags are ref's that point to
                            specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to capture a point in history that
                            is
                            used for a marked version release. A tag is like a branch that doesn’t change. Unlike
                            branches,
                            tags, after being created, have no further history of commits. To get list of tags use git
                            tag
                            command.</p>
                        <p>Repository:</p>
                        <p>
                            A Git stores an information in a data structure called a repository. A Git repository is the
                            .git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your
                            project,
                            building a history over time. Meaning, if you delete the .git/ folder, then you delete your
                            project’s history. In the main page of GitHub, we can repositories with different names. It
                            can
                            be either private or public.</p>
