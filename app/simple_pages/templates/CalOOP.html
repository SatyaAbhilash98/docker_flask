                        <p>Encapsulation :</p>
                        <p>
                            Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It
                            describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This
                            puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental
                            modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed
                            by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variable. A class is an
                            example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions,
                            variables, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Calculator program, in all the Python files the methods are Encapsulated under the class.
                            For example:- In calculation.py, class Calculation encapsulates method,__init__(),
                            convert_args_to_list_float(), create(), get_result(). To access any of these methods we will
                            have to call class Calculation and then can access the method.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections
                            like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles
                            all the financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance.
                            Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of
                            all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official from the
                            finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is
                            not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first have to contact
                            some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data.
                            This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can
                            manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”. Using encapsulation also
                            hides the data. In this example, the data of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts
                            are hidden from any other section.
                        </p>
                        <p>Inheritance :</p>
                        <p>
                            Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another
                            class. The benefits of inheritance are:
                            1. It represents real-world relationships well.
                            2. It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again.
                            Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
                            3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A,
                            then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Calculator program, in every operation file i.e., addition.py, subtraction.py,
                            multiplication.py, division.py the method get_result() is defined with its operations
                            performed in it. And in all the testing files i.e. addition_test.py, subtraction_test.py,
                            multiplication_test.py, division_test.py, that get_result() method is inherited by importing
                            that class in the test class and it is performing the operations which are declared in the
                            normal operation files. So this is the example of Inheritance in the Calculator program.

                        <p>
                        <p>Different forms of Inheritance:</p>
                        <li> 1. Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called
                            single inheritance. We saw an example above.
                        </li>
                        <li> 2. Multiple inheritance: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is
                            called multiple inheritance. Unlike Java and like C++, Python supports multiple inheritance.
                            We specify all parent classes as a comma-separated list in the bracket.
                        </li>
                        <li> 3. Multilevel inheritance: When we have a child and grandchild relationship.</li>
                        <li> 4. Hierarchical inheritance More than one derived classes are created from a single base.
                        </li>
                        <li> 5. Hybrid inheritance: This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it
                            is a blend of more than one type of inheritance.
                        </li>
                        </p>
                        <p>Abstraction :</p>
                        <p>
                            An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to
                            create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the
                            abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract
                            class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an
                            implementation. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. When
                            we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use
                            an abstract class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Calculation program, calculation.py file is using an abstract method. First we have
                            imported the Abstract Method and then we have declared it on the method which we have to
                            make abstract. In this code get_result() is an abstract method. In the main method it is
                            just returning True value. But other files have called that methods to give it its
                            functionality. For Example: in addition.py get_result() is returning sum of the numbers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How Abstract Base classes work : By default, Python does not provide abstract classes.
                            Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC)
                            and that module name is ABC. ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract
                            and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base. A method
                            becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Abstract Class Instantiation : Abstract classes are incomplete because they have methods
                            that have nobody. If python allows creating an object for abstract classes then using that
                            object if anyone calls the abstract method, but there is no actual implementation to invoke.
                            So we use an abstract class as a template and according to the need, we extend it and build
                            on it before we can use it. Due to the fact, an abstract class is not a concrete class, it
                            cannot be instantiated. When we create an object for the abstract class it raises an error.
                        </p>
                        <p>Polymorphism :</p>
                        <p>
                            What is Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming,
                            polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for
                            different types.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Calculator program, get_result() method is the best example of Polymorphism with
                            Inheritance. Polymorphism means one method having different functionality. In calculator
                            program, get_result is an abstract method which returns nothing in the main file which is
                            calculation.py. But in addition.py it returns the sum of numbers. In subtraction.py it
                            returns the subtraction of numbers. In multiplication.py it returns the multiplication of
                            numbers. In division.py it returns the division of numbers. This is how Polymorphism is used
                            in Calculator program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Polymorphism with Inheritance: In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child
                            class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child
                            class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method
                            in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in
                            cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t quite fit the child class. In
                            such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a
                            method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.
