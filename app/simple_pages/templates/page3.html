                        <p>
                            First, I created a repository in the github then I created two apps in Heroku one for dev
                            and
                            one for production. Now from Heroku account settings I extracted Heroku API key then added
                            to
                            the git repo secrets. Next, I created a new repo in the docker hub and added docker username
                            and
                            passwords to the git repo secrets. After this if he run the docker container the app will be
                            tested and will be ran in the Heroku dev app every time we pull the git repo and every time,
                            we
                            make changes and merge the prod app in the Heroku will be updated.
                        </p>

                            When you set up automated builds, you create a list of branches and tags that you want to
                            build
                            into Docker images. When you push code to a source code branch (for example in GitHub) for
                            one
                            of those listed image tags, the push uses a webhook to trigger a new build, which produces a
                            Docker image. The built image is then pushed to the Docker Hub registry.

                            Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate
                            their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple
                            integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build. The term
                            'Continuous
                            Integration' originated with Kent Beck's Extreme Programming development process, as one of
                            its
                            original twelve practices.

                            Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a
                            way
                            that the software can be released to production at any time. Continuous Delivery is
                            sometimes
                            confused with Continuous Deployment. Continuous Deployment means that every change goes
                            through
                            the pipeline and automatically gets put into production, resulting in many production
                            deployments every day. Continuous Delivery just means that you are able to do frequent
                            deployments but may choose not to do it, usually due to businesses preferring a slower rate
                            of
                            deployment. In order to do Continuous Deployment, you must be doing Continuous Delivery.
